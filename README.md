## Resources

* [Choose A License](http://choosealicense.com/) - Helpful website for picking out a license for your project.
* [Github flavored markdown reference](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) - Github's own documentation about documentation.
* [Online Markdown Editor](https://rentry.co//) - Online write and share markdown content.
  
## Sample READMEs
Consider four README's for four different projects below:

As you examine each of the README's, take note of the following:

>* What information is being communicated?
>* How is this information structured?
>* Do you notice any patterns?

* [Aleph](https://github.com/alephdata/aleph) - Aleph is a tool for indexing large amounts of both documents (PDF, Word, HTML) and structured (CSV, XLS, SQL) data for easy browsing and search.. The documentation is thorough and complete, so anybody can use it!
* [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) - An open source project maintained by thoughtbot. Great example of simple instructions to get you set up, which then links to external documentation.
* [can.viewify](https://github.com/zkat/can.viewify) - Awesome example of someone documenting her personal projects concisely.
* [ecommerce](https://github.com/kkosiba/ecommerce-backend) - This README is for one ecommerce backend app.


## What to include in documentation? 
* What are the exact steps that need to be taken to get this code base up and running?
* What should users already have installed or configured?
* What might they have a hard time understanding right away?
**The important part is that you communicate clearly and concisely any information that is essential for the user!**
